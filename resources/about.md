# About

CDNperf started as a collaboration between [jsDelivr](http://www.jsdelivr.com/), a CDN, and [JSter](http://jster.net/), a JavaScript catalog. We noticed it was difficult to find information on JavaScript CDNs. As a result an idea of a service was born. I have covered the history in more detail at [SAM blog](http://www.speedawarenessmonth.com/cdnperf-understand-how-cdns-perform/).

## Sponsors

It would not have been possible to develop CDNperf without sponsors. We are grateful to [Pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com/) for providing access to their data. We also want to compliment [BlueVM](https://bluevm.com/) hosting the service.

## Improving

As just understanding how well various CDNs perform isn't enough, we have a set of articles related to the topic. It is early days for the [article section](/resources) still. Guest authors are welcome!

In case you want to become one or happen to have improvement ideas in general, either use that widget of ours at bottom right or contact us through [the issue tracker](https://github.com/bebraw/cdnperf/issues). If email is your thing, you can contact me through GMail (user: bebraw).
